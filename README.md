# Elvish-Large-Language-Model
This repository will be focused on training and evaluating LLM's to understand the Elvish languages of J.R.R. Tolkiens Middle Earth. More specifcally, we will be focusing on training LLaMA and LLaMA 2 to understand the most relevant Elvish language, Sindarin. Sindarin, was the common spoken language of the Elves in Middle-earth during the events of "The Lord of the Rings." It was also learned and spoken by some Men, like the DÃºnedain.
